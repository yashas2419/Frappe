## Frappe Education
Frappe Education is an open-source and user-friendly Education Management System designed to streamline the administrative and academic processes of educational institutions. It is a powerful module based on the ERPNext software.

### Motivation
All the tools to manage which are available in the market were just not good enough.They were way too scatered, or too expensive or too complex to use. We wanted to create a tool that is easy to use, affordable and can be customized as per the needs of the institution.
Frappe Education is dedicated to making education management more efficient and less time-consuming.
